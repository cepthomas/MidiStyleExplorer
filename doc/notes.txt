Each of the other markers (Intro A, Main B, etc) defines musical patterns that are triggered by
the keying chords. Intros play only once when triggered and then turn control over to the next
section selected by the panel buttons. Main sections (A, B, C, and D) repeat until the style is
stopped or an Ending or an Intro is selected. Ending sections play once and the style is
stopped. Fill Ins are triggered manually, or play automatically (if Auto Fill is On) when a new
main section is selected.

 Get events.strictChecking: If true will error on non-paired note events

The common order of the sections in the file is at follows:
1. Midi section
2. CASM section
3. OTS (One Touch Setting) section
4. MDB (Music Finder) section
5. MH section

In very rare cases there is a MH section at the end of the style file. Nothing is known about the purpose of this section.

Internally, a style starts by specifying the tempo, the time signature and the copyright followed by several sections that are defined by marker events.

The first two sections, SFF1 (or SFF2) and SInt, occupying the first measure of the midi part, include a Midi On plus midi commands to setup the default instruments and the amount of DSP (only DSP1 as a system effect is available for styles) used for each track.

Each of the other markers (Intro A, Main B, etc) defines musical patterns that are triggered by the keying chords. Intros play only once when triggered and then turn control over to the next section selected by the panel buttons. Main sections (A, B, C, and D) repeat until the style is stopped or an Ending or an Intro is selected. Ending sections play once and the style is stopped. Fill Ins are triggered manually, or play automatically (if Auto Fill is On) when a new main section is selected.

When a style is playing in the instrument, the SFF and SInt sections are executed when a style section is changed. This resets the voices and other channel parameters to their initial values. Because of this, if its is desired to change the voice or other settings for a single section, new settings can be inserted in only this section and the style will revert to the default whenever another section is selected.

StyleDump (by Michael P. Bedesem)

StyleDump is a general purpose file viewer for:
    Yamaha style files (SFF1 & 2)
    Section midi data (Main A, Ending A, etc)
    CASM
    OTS
    MusicFinder database entries
    Midi song files
    Voice edit files

The listings include midi events, meta events, sysex events and any special commands, where known. Wherever possible and appropriate, the contents, including sysex commands, have been translated to English descriptions and decimal values. The displayed information may be sorted, searched, columns rearranged, printed, or copied to the clipboard. While the program MidiPlayer includes some of these capabilities, StyleDump works on the raw data, whereas MidiPlayer performs inter-instrument conversions and file corrections
