# MidiStyleExplorer
A windows tool for playing audio and midi file clips. This is intended to be used for auditioning parts for use in compositions created in a real DAW.
To that end, and because the windows multimedia timer has inadequate accuracy for midi notes, resolution is limited to 32nd notes.

# Usage
- If midi file type is one, all tracks are combined. Because.
- Opens Yamaha style (.sty) files and plays the individual sections.
- Export current selection to a new midi file. Useful for snipping style patterns.
- Click on the settings icon to edit your options.
- Some midi files with single instruments are sloppy with channel numbers so there are a couple of options for simple remapping.
- In the log view: C for clear, W for word wrap toggle.
